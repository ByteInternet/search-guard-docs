<h1 id="field-level-security">Field-level security</h1>

<p>Field-level security controls which fields a user is able to see. As with document-level security, FLS can be defined per role and per index. Search Guard supports including (whitelisting) and excluding (blacklisting) fields from documents.</p>

<p>In order to restrict access to certain fields, you simply list the fields to be excluded or included on the same indentation level as the document types.</p>

<h2 id="including-fields">Including fields</h2>

<p>In this mode, only fields listed in the FLS section of the role definition are returned by Search Guard. In the example below, only the fields <code class="highlighter-rouge">Designation</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">FirstName</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">LastName</code> are included in the returned documents. All other fields are filtered out:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">hr_employee</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="s">...</span>
  <span class="s">indices</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">humanresources'</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">employees'</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="s">...</span>
      <span class="na">_dls_</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">...</span>
      <span class="na">_fls_</span><span class="pi">:</span>
        <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">Designation'</span>
        <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">FirstName'</span>
        <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">LastName'</span>
    <span class="err"> </span><span class="s">...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="excluding-fields">Excluding fields</h2>

<p>If you rather want to exclude than include fields, simply prefix all fields with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">~</code>. In the example below, all fields except <code class="highlighter-rouge">Designation</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">FirstName</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">LastName</code> are returned by Search Guard:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">hr_employee</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="s">...</span>
  <span class="s">indices</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">humanresources'</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">employees'</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="s">...</span>
      <span class="na">_dls_</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">...</span>
      <span class="na">_fls_</span><span class="pi">:</span>
        <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">~Designation'</span>
        <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">~FirstName'</span>
        <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">~LastName'</span>
    <span class="err"> </span><span class="s">...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="using-wildcards">Using wildcards</h2>

<p>You can use wildcards when definig FLS field, both for include and exclude mode.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">*Name'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>only returns fields that end with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Name</code>, while on the other hand</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">~*Name'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>would filter our all fields that end with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Name</code>.</p>

<p>An asterisk matches any character sequence, while a question mark will match any single character.</p>

<p>Using wildcards with FLS security will have an effect on the overall performance, especially if you are dealing with documents that contain a huge number of fields. If possible, they should be avoided. See also chapter “Performance considerations” below.</p>

<h2 id="mixing-included-and-excluded-fields">Mixing included and excluded fields</h2>

<p>Mixing included and excluded fields per role and index does not make sense and leads to undefined results.</p>

<p>Please make sure that the FLS definition(s) of an authenticated user is either include only, or exclude only!</p>

<h2 id="multiple-roles-and-field-level-security">Multiple roles and field-level security</h2>

<p>As with document-level security, if a user is member of multiple roles it is important to understand how the FLS settings for these roles are combined.</p>

<p>In case of FLS, the FLS field definitions of the roles are combined with <code class="highlighter-rouge">AND</code>. If you use FLS <code class="highlighter-rouge">include</code> (whitelisting) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">exclude</code> (blacklisting) definitions for different roles, you need to make sure that for each user and its roles the combination of the FLS field is either include only, or exclude only.</p>

<h2 id="dlsfls-execution-order">DLS/FLS Execution Order</h2>

<p>If you use both DLS and FLS, all fields that you are basing the DLS query on must be visible, i.e. not filtered by FLS. Otherwise, your DLS query will not work properly.</p>
