<h1 id="managing-the-search-guard-index">Managing the Search Guard index</h1>

<h2 id="index-name">Index name</h2>

<p>If nothing else is specified, Search Guard uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">searchguard</code> as the name of the index where all configuration settings are stored.</p>

<p>You can configure the name of the Search Guard index. This is only necessary in special cases. If you have configured a Search Guard index name other than <code class="highlighter-rouge">searchguard</code>, you must configure this name via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-i</code> switch.</p>

<h2 id="replica-shards">Replica shards</h2>

<p>Search Guard manages the number of replica shards of the Search Guard index automatically. If the Search Guard index is created for the first time, the number of replica shards is set to the number of nodes - 1. If you add or remove nodes, the number of shards will be increased or decreased automatically. This means that a primary or replica shard of the Search Guard index is available on all nodes.</p>

<p>If you want to manage the number of replica shards yourself, you can disable the replica auto-expand feature by using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-dra</code> switch of sgadmin. To set the number of replica shards, use sgadmin with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-us</code> switch. To re-enable replica auto-expansion, use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-dra</code> switch. See also section “Index and replica settings” in the <a href="sgadmin.md">sgadmin chapter</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-us</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">-era</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-dra</code> only apply if there is an existing Search Guard index.</p>
