<p>As an alternative to X-Pack Alerting and X-Pack Monitoring, we recommend Sentinl by <a href="https://siren.io/" target="_blank">Siren Solutions</a>)</p>

<p>Sentinl</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] extends Kibi/Kibana 5 with Alerting and Reporting functionality to monitor, notify and report on data series changes using standard queries, programmable validators and a variety of configurable actions - Think of it as a free an independent “Watcher” which also has scheduled “Reporting” capabilities (PNG/PDFs snapshots). SENTINL is also designed to simplify the process of creating and managing alerts and reports in Kibi/Kibana via its App and Spy integration, directly in the Kibi/Kibana UI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/sirensolutions/sentinl" target="_blank">https://github.com/sirensolutions/sentinl</a>)</p>

<p>It’s completely free, Open Source, compatible with Search Guard, and a perfect alternative to X-Pack Alerting and X-Pack Monitoring.</p>

<p>In the following description, we assume that you have already installed Elasticsearch and Search Guard.</p>

<h2 id="installing-sentinl">Installing Sentinl</h2>

<p>Sentinl can be installed like any other Kibana plugin. Simply follow the installation instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/sirensolutions/sentinl">Sentinl Github Page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-search-guard-for-sentinl">Configuring Search Guard for Sentinl</h2>

<p>In order to use Sentinl with Search Guard, the <a href="kibana_installation.md">Kibana server user role</a> requires additionl permissions. If you use the demo roles shipped with Search Guard, add the following permissions for the Sentinl internal watcher <code class="highlighter-rouge">indices</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sg_kibana_server:
  cluster:
    ...
  indices:
    ...
    'watcher*':
      '*':
       - indices:data/read/search
       - MANAGE
       - CREATE_INDEX
       - INDEX
       - READ
       - WRITE
       - DELETE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <a href="kibana_installation.md">Kibana server user role</a> also needs read access to all indices that you want to create alerts or reports for:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sg_kibana_server:
  cluster:
    ...
  indices:
    ...
    'watcher*':
      '*':
       - indices:data/read/search
       - MANAGE
       - CREATE_INDEX
       - INDEX
       - READ
       - WRITE
       - DELETE
    'human_resources':
      '*':
       - indices:data/read/search
    'finance':
      '*':
       - indices:data/read/search
    ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to be able to create alerts and reports for all indices, use a wildcard as index name:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sg_kibana_server:
  cluster:
    ...
  indices:
    ...
    'watcher*':
      '*':
       - indices:data/read/search
       - MANAGE
       - CREATE_INDEX
       - INDEX
       - READ
       - WRITE
       - DELETE
    '*':
      '*':
       - indices:data/read/search
    ...
</code></pre></div></div>
