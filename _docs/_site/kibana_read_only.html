<h1 id="read-only-mode">Read only mode</h1>

<p>Search Guard provides a read only mode for Kibana. When a user is assigned to this mode, only the Dashboards and, if configured, the Multitenancy navigation entries are accessible.</p>

<p>Thus, a user can view already configured dashboards and change tenants, but is not able to use any other functionalities of Kibana.</p>

<h2 id="defining-read-only-roles">Defining read only roles</h2>

<p>The Kibana read only mode is based on the Search Guard roles of a user:</p>

<p>If a user is assigned to one or more configured <em>read only roles</em>, the Kibana read only mode is activated automatically upon login.</p>

<p>Use the following entry in <code class="highlighter-rouge">kibana.yml</code> to configure the read only roles:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>searchguard.readonly_mode.roles: ["sg_read_only_1", "sg_read_only_2", ...]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If a Search Guard user has either the role <code class="highlighter-rouge">sg_read_only_1</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">sg_read_only_2</code>, the Kibana read only mode is activated.</p>

<p>In read only mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only the Dashboard application is accessible</li>
  <li>Only the Dashboard and (if configured) the Multitenancy links are visible</li>
  <li>The controls to create, edit and delete Dashboards are hidden</li>
  <li>All tenants are switched to read only automatically</li>
</ul>
